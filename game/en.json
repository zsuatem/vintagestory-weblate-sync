Furthermore, the larger format bricks of 4 courses per block, can be crafted to a smaller size that has double the courses.<br><br><strong>Polychromy</strong><br><br>different colors of bricks can be combined via chiseling, and 3 basic patterns can be made - running, soldier, and header bonds.  Each of these bonds can also be switched to an offset variant, and running bonds have an additional two variants (1/4 offset and 3/4 offset).  Via the use of these three basic patterns and their offsets, virtually any pattern of brickwork can be made.  Research 'brick polychromy' to learn more.",

This is particularly valuable in hot climates or during summer, as food spoils quicker in the heat, and for long winters when less food is available. There are several food preservation methods, combining them can have a multiplicative effect.<br><br><strong>Cellars</strong><br>Any fully enclosed space is considered a cellar and will have a low and consistent year-round temperature. The most simple cellar consists of a 1x2x1 hole with a container in it, that's covered up with soil. More elaborate versions can be up to 7x7x7 blocks in size with a door. To verify a cellar is working, look at any container's block info. You will want to reach the lowest possible food perish speed. Build cellar walls from soil, brick or stone materials.<br><br><strong>Crocks</strong><br>You can place <a href=\"handbook://craftinginfo-mealcooking\">meals</a> inside <a href=\"handbooksearch://ceramic crock\">crocks</a> to receive a slight benefit, but sealing crocks with <a href=\"handbook://item-beeswax\">wax</a> or <a href=\"handbook://item-fat\">fat</a> further decreases the decay rate 10-fold. To seal a crock, simply place it on the ground and use the sealing item on it.

Most animals require only a breeding pair to be given enough food and time to reproduce, but poultry (chickens) also require a <a href=\"handbook://block-henbox\">henbox</a> in which they can lay and incubate their eggs. If there are not enough henboxes the hens will instead lay their eggs on the ground, which will not hatch, but can still be eaten.<br><br><strong>Domestication</strong><br>Animals bred this way will, over several generations, lose their fear and aggressiveness towards the player.

Be sure to place some flowers around. You can move a populated skep inside a free backpack slot by <hk>rightmouse</hk> clicking it. Carry it to the desired location and use <hk>Ctrl</hk>+Scroll wheel to select that backpack slot, to place the skep back down again. Your bees will visit nearby flowers and slowly produce honey, a richly populated skep can also in turn swarm to start a new bee colony in a nearby empty skep. When your skep colony is mature, break it to remove the <a href=\"handbook://item-honeycomb\">honeycomb</a>, note that this is quite likely to anger the bees. Angry bees can become diverted if there happens to be anything nearby which <a href=\"handbook://item-strawdummy\">could be mistaken for you</a>. Squeeze the honeycomb over an open container or in the <a href=\"handbooksearch://fruitpress\">fruitpress</a> to extract the honey, leaving wax.

Not all fruit trees can survive in all climates.<br><br><strong>Growth Habits</strong><br>Fruit trees start small, but over a long time period will get very large, bit by bit; they do not instantly grow to maturity like regular trees. <br>They only bear fruit once a year, and this time will vary by the type. They will go through stages of flowering, fruit bearing, and fruit ripening. Trees of temperate climates will go through a dormancy period where they have no leaves.<br><br><strong>Propagation</strong><br>You can propagate fruit trees by removing a branch to get a cutting, and then planting the cutting on dirt, or placing the cutting onto the cut branch stub of another fruit tree. Only a portion of grafts will succeed, and an even smaller number of planted cuttings.",

	"gamemechanicinfo-steelmaking-text": "<strong>Steelmaking</strong><br><i>Scorching hot ovens abound, telltale signs of industry</i><br><br>The earliest form of steel, Blister Steel, requires the construction of a cementation furnace. This structure is used to slowly enrich iron with carbon (carburization).<br><br><strong>Construction</strong><br>Building a cementation furnace requires around 65 blocks of refractory bricks, which come in 3 different qualities: <a href=\"handbook://block-refractorybricks-good-tier1\">tier 1</a>, <a href=\"handbook://block-refractorybricks-good-tier2\">tier 2</a> and <a href=\"handbook://block-refractorybricks-good-tier3\">tier 3</a>. Each tier is more robust against heat damage than the last. You will also need 6 <a href=\"handbooksearch://refractory brick grating\">refractory brick gratings</a> and a solid or windowed <a href=\"handbooksearch://iron door\">iron door</a>. Build two <a href=\"handbooksearch://stone coffin section\">stone coffin sections</a> and <a href=\"handbooksearch://stone coffin lid\">two stone coffin lids</a> from either granite, andesite, basalt or peridotite. Place a 3x2 flooring of grating. In the middle of it, place both stone coffin sections in opposing directions, so as to create a large container. With a <hk>shift</hk> + <hk>rightmouse</hk> click on the stone coffin you will see an outline showing where you have to place the remaining refractory bricks and the iron door. You can add additional refractory bricks on the outside of the structure, if you wish, but keep the air pathways in the interior of the structure clear.<br><br><strong>Firing</strong><br>Once that is ready, fill the stone coffin to the top with 16 iron ingots and charcoal or coke. Then, dig out an empty space two blocks below each stone coffin section - this is where you have to place 2 piles of coal (or charcoal) in order to fire the furnace. You can use a chisel to build a small retaining wall so that the coal doesn't fall to the sides while piling. Once all is ready, ignite the coal piles.<br><br>You can verify the furnace is working by looking into it through the door (but we don't recommend you go inside there, it's quite hot!) Fire particles should emanate from the burning coal and smoke should exit from the chimney. You will need to replenish and re-light the coal piles approximately once a day, but leave the stone coffin closed. Firing will take about one week in total, after which you can break the stone coffin to get <a href=\"handbook://item-ingot-blistersteel\">blister steel</a>.<br><br><strong>Refining</strong><br>Blister steel needs to be worked on an iron anvil to create steel. You can create an iron anvil by smithing the bottom and top halfs on a bronze anvil. Place the parts on the ground on top of each other with some flux in between, then hammer a few times to create the iron anvil.",

Once you have filled the kiln with clay products, ignite the fuel piles and close the door. After several cycles, there will be a chance for the refractory bricks to become damaged and require replacement, similar to the cementation furnace.

	"lore-blindbatrickhart-piece1": "Never go into the caves. Never go under the ground. Haven't you heard the story of Blind Bat Rickhart? He was a young boy, just like you lot. Curious, rambunctious, and ready for adventure. Some say he was born in one of the villages around here.\r\n\r\nWell there wasn't much to do in the fields for a boy like that. He couldn't be bothered with tilling the soil or gathering wheat. One year, as it came to be harvest season, he decided to slip away while everyone else was working. He knew his father would be furious, but Rickhart was a greedy boy and he wanted his adventure.\r\n\r\nAfter a long day of traipsing through the heath and forest, young Rickhart had had a great deal of fun, and now the wrath of his father was clear in his mind. He was terrified of going home, so he decided he would stay out for the night and give his father time to calm down and worry about him.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't very bright, but he wasn't very stupid either. He at least knew better than to be caught roaming about at night. By the time the sun was almost gone, he had stumbled upon a deep, well-hidden cave and decided he would pass the night there. ___NEWPAGE___",
	"lore-blindbatrickhart-piece2": "Well, the sun went down, and he had himself a nice fire built just near the mouth of the cave. He was safe and hidden there, but the rocky floor was uncomfortable and Rickhart was bored of sitting around. So he decided to play a little game with himself. He would walk into the cave's darkness and see which gave out first: his courage or the cave.\r\n\r\nSo he started walking deeper into the cave, brushing off all the warnings his parents and elders had given him since he was born. They had always told him that there were dark things under the earth. Darker even than the monsters we see at night. Rickhart was scared, for sure, but that was all the more thrilling for him. He felt himself just getting into the real adventure as he took one step and then another, deeper and deeper. ___NEWPAGE___",
	"lore-blindbatrickhart-piece3": "His heart beat like a drum on festival night, but he kept going. He was giggling now, thinking how much fun he was having. He was sure it was all just a silly jaunt, but the images of torn flesh, long hairy limbs, and scraping metal started to fill his head. He could hear his grandmother's ragged voice as he remembered all the old stories she'd told him about the Drifters and horrible Groundlings.\r\n\r\nOn the verge of giving up and running, he bumped headfirst into the cave wall. He'd made it to the end. He breathed a sigh of relief, did a small jig to celebrate his victory, and turned to walk back to his warm fire— only, when he took his first step back the ground gave out beneath him. He fell and fell through the earth, scraping and tearing his skin all the way down. ___NEWPAGE___",
	"lore-blindbatrickhart-piece4": "When he finally came to stop and got a chance to right himself, he was far below the little cave where he had started. Now young, foolish Rickhart had only one thing in mind: he wanted to get home as quickly as he could. That being said, he couldn't see anything in the immense darkness, and he was so disoriented from the fall that he wasn't quite sure which way he'd came from. All he could tell was that he had landed in a large cavern, and that he could only figure out by the echoing sounds of the rocks sliding after him. ___NEWPAGE___",
	"lore-blindbatrickhart-piece5": "So he started feeling his way around, looking for something, anything to give him some direction. His hands found a rock face, but something was strange about it. The rock was smooth to the touch. He followed it for a couple feet and realized it formed an entire wall of smooth, even rock. There was some kind of wall here, carved into the earth.\r\n\r\nHaving no other option, Rickhart held his hand to the wall and used it as a guide, walking alongside it, but it led him deeper into the cavern. He followed it for a while, until it suddenly fell away and Rickhart lost his balance, stumbling to the ground. He stood up, and decided to not risk venturing further. He held onto the wall again and tried to walk back to the place where he thought he'd fallen through the dirt.\r\n\r\nOnly, after walking a good distance, he found himself somehow further into the cavern, judging by the sound of his footsteps. In his confusion, he reached out into the open darkness beyond the wall... And felt his hands touching another strange, carved stone wall. He realized suddenly that this was some kind of maze, full of walls in the same shape and design; he must have latched onto the wrong wall after falling onto the ground. ___NEWPAGE___",

He suddenly remembered all the warnings he'd been given. Never go underground. There are dark things there. Terrors that you can't understand. Rickhart's skin jumped. He felt eyes on him. These unknown 'things' watching him. Waiting for him. He hears movement. A skittering echoes through the cavern. It's getting closer.\r\n\r\nPanicking, Rickhart turned and ran through the maze, stumbling from wall to wall, moving as fast as he could to get away from the skittering. He could still hear it getting closer. He could hear it breathing now, quiet and shrill. He could feel it just behind him. Something large and bristling with hair. He was terrified. He was sure this was the end. ___NEWPAGE___",

Rickhart was pushed back onto the ground from the impact. The skittering stopped. In its place, this large metal thing started to move.\r\n\r\nHe heard clicking, cranking, stomping, steaming, and other unrecognizable sounds. The thing seemed to be turning about to face him. He was frozen, trying desperately to disappear and somehow wake up in the warm wheat fields and smell his mother's cooking, but instead all he could smell was something like eggs left cracked and burning in the sun.\r\n\r\nThe thing stopped moving. Stopped making noises. Just stood there, like a statue. Gathering his wits about him for a moment, Rickhart realized perhaps it hadn't actually noticed him. Just as he was about to crawl away, the thing suddenly shined one huge light in his face. Rickhart screamed.___NEWPAGE___",

They took him home and did what they could to take care of him, but he was never the same after that. His vision never came back. He would still have shaking fits from time to time. It took his family years to finally get him to tell them what happened. They told the rest of the village about it, and the story spread from there.\r\n\r\nSometimes he would tell the story to curious travelers and young children. There was one thing he always said. One thing he always finished his story with. 'Do you remember the giant metal thing I mentioned?' he would say, leaning in close. He'd whisper, 'The thing that shined a light on me? Well, the truth is, it wasn't a light at all. No, not at all. It was an eye, you know. It saw me. Stared into me. I can feel it staring at me all the time. Except when I tell this story. Then it looks away from me. And where do you think it looks instead? I'm sure you'll figure it out.'",

His inventions grew equally more wondrous and monstrous. The eidolons, the locusts, the things without which our endeavor would fail: these he created and shared freely with the world. The people, both common and titled, began to see him as a shining light here to guide them to a new era. In truth, perhaps that would have come to pass were it not for the great adversity we were soon confronted with.\r\n\r\nSoon, the country would begin to understand its own fragility. Each day there were new reports. Refugees wandering from town to town. It felt as though we had all been sentenced to death. That helplessness returns to me still, when I close my eyes. When the emperor sent out the call for assembly, Jonas was among those compelled to find a solution.\r\n\r\nI was there when he was told the news. I remember finding it strange when for a moment his face ran pale and he seemed to shake with fright. But there was nothing strange about that, I see now. He locked himself in his laboratory and bade me not to disturb him. For months he continued this way, leaving only to eat and drink. His youthful looks quickly deteriorated and it seemed as though a great weight bore down on him. He emerged in time for the Diet, with a heavy, unwieldy pile of schematics. ___NEWPAGE___",

I have seen noble and commoner work, sing, weep, and die side by side. I have seen horrors, but I have seen humanity face them with hard eyes and clenched fists. I have struggled alongside the fiercest stars of our ruined land: scholars, engineers, soldiers, hunters, merchants, even beggars. All who found the strength to resist our doom.

There was nothing out there. No light. No trees. No birds and no music. What horror! A great miasma of nothingness. Can you imagine such a place? Through this emptiness a woman crawled. Alone. Starving. Lost. She only knew suffering. Only knew pain and grief. But she continued living, because she did not know of any other path.___NEWPAGE___",

She was the first to walk our world. Our home.\r\nThus she came to know joy. But when the sun left the sky and the night fell over the new land, she heard the whispers, the groans, the crunching footsteps of those abominable shades that haunt us still. She then came to know fear, and a dreadful fear it was! She fled into the dirt and the quiet places. Deeper down she went, hounded by the foul voices, until she came upon something hidden and strange. There in the dark she found herself in the presence of a god. ___NEWPAGE___",

Every day she would rest and enjoy the bountiful wonders of this world, and every night she would rise and battle the creatures that came to hunt her.\r\nShe felled hundreds of them, yet they always returned. As time passed by, she grew wise.\r\nClimbing to the high mountaintops, she called out- Called out! In a clear voice that rang through the dales, she called, \r\n'I am Bearfirth! I am mighty! If you hear my voice, come find me! Come look for me in the plains, in the forests, by the rivers! Find me, and you too will be mighty!'\r\n\r\nAnd her voice was heard. Other men and women appeared. Those who had been hiding in the dirt and the roots. In the gray shadows. They heard her voice and were entranced. They followed it to the source and came together as a crowd before her. They were fearful and hungry. \r\n___NEWPAGE___",

The people rejoiced when they saw this, but Bearfirth, upon realizing she would not have to battle anything that night, felt the years and years of exhaustion, once held back through willpower, now fall upon her as a flood. Collapsing to the ground, she knew that her life was at its end. \r\nThe people gathered around her, fearful and lost again at the thought of her leave-taking.

They're still out there, screaming at us now!\r\nBut her people do not run. They have an oath to fulfill. They build the walls stronger and trust that Bearfirth will hold up her end of the bargain. When the sun finally returns, it finds them proud and cheering. At last they know the madness that Bearfirth knew: They learned that by fighting in the face of hopelessness they could accomplish anything.\r\nWith their newfound strength, they worked together and made a grand village.

	"lore-miller-piece1": "The Pond\n\nWhat could have been if this chaos had not come between us? I can't stop thinking about him, it grieves me, drives me mad. All I can do now is to write down these memories and draw what I remember with charcoal from the dying fire.\n\nI remember the first time I saw him vividly since it was such an unusually beautiful and peaceful day. The harvest of rye had begun but I snuck away early that day from the workers to enjoy the still summer evening out in the forest. Leaves rustled softly as I walked and small twigs crackled under my feet. Bushes and ferns brushed against my legs and arms.\n\nI reached a glade with fallen trees and pools of water. I made myself comfortable, laying on top of a few moss covered rocks. The surface was dry and soft and the cranberries were blooming all over, buzzing with life. Looking up between the treetops I saw the partly cloudy sky. I would do anything to go back to that moment.\n\nFeeling drowsy from the sweet, warm air I closed my eyes and just listened. I heard crows scrambling around in the trees and small bits of branches splashed down into the water beneath. Bees were humming to and fro close by my face. A fox barked in the distance.\n\nFootsteps, branches snapping and brushing of vegetation. The sound stirred me from the haze. I thought it was a deer. It was very faint, but getting closer. I looked up and saw a tall man slowly walking towards the bigger pond in the glade. He sat himself down on an old log right by the water. He sat very still, as did I, and just looked at the water and the bugs that were dancing there.\n\nHe was fair and had light, long hair with wavy locks. His gaze was cold but at the same time gentle and at ease. By the look of his rugged hands, strong shoulders, and patched linen clothes he was a hardworking man.___NEWPAGE___",
	"lore-miller-piece2": "He leaned forward and picked something from the ground. He looked at his find and pulled a string from his pocket. After a brief moment of tinkering he seemed to have made a necklace that he hung around his neck. A gentle smile spread across his face as he held up the adornment piece in his hand, admiring his simple creation.\n\nI was careful to stay still, not making my presence known. I did not want to disrupt the stillness with my awkwardness. And at the same time I could not take my eyes off him.\n\nHe brought out a piece of folded, yellowed parchment out of his belt bag that he proceeded to scribble on, pausing every now and then looking up, his thoughts seemingly far away.\n\nCarefully he put away the parchment and got down on his knees by the clear forest pool and cupped his hands. He took a sip and then splashed his face, making his short beard glitter with water drops.\n\nHe removed the necklace he had made and hung it on a thin, leafed branch, looked out over the pond one last time and then contentedly walked away through the brush.\n\nOf course I was curious and walked over to the place he had been and inspected the necklace he had made. It was made out of a large acorn from one of the nearby oak trees. If I had only had the bravery to get up and greet him that first time I saw him. But who was I, a shy cow farmer's daughter to do that?___NEWPAGE___",
	"lore-miller-piece3": "The Carriage\n\nAs the harvest season went by and autumn was reaching its end, I sometimes went back to the ponds in the forest where I had first seen that mysterious man. I had not seen him before in my village nor could I remember seeing him in the neighboring village either. It was like he had appeared out of nowhere and I couldn't stop thinking about him, to the point where it almost hurt.\n\nThe acorn necklace still hung there, untouched. The summergreen color of the seed was gone and it had turned into a shiny bronze. At some point I realized that he probably wouldn’t come back for it, so I took it and put it around my neck. I felt silly but it was pretty, in a childish and playful way.\n\nMy life on the farm got more busy and rough as winter approached. The cows needed to be fed several times a day as well as the morning and evening milking. The water in their troughs froze and firewood in our cottage was running low. When the winds were just about to turn freezing and snow was in the air I brought with me my little wooden cart, to the nearby spruce forest to gather some firewood logs to take home and cut.\n\nAs I was struggling with the frozen logs a small horse wagon, loaded with sacks and covered from the snow, came rolling on the muddy forest path. The driver had a thick cloak with a hood covering half his face. The gray, heavy mare was trotting energetically but slowed down to a walk at the light tug of the drivers hands on the reins. The snow was starting to come down heavy and my clothes were by now all covered in white.\n\nThe driver stepped off the wagon and put up a hand in the air as a greeting. I hesitantly waived back. He pulled out a thick blanket and threw it over his horse. He stroked the old, gray mare between the ears and she snorted content. The driver turned to me.\n\n“Do you need cover from the storm, lass?” he said in a concerned manner.\n\n“If you need help, that is.”___NEWPAGE___",
	"lore-miller-piece4": "Since I was getting cold from the snow and wind I precariously walked over and stepped into the wagon. It was dark and not much space, but at least it was dry and sheltered from the wind.\n\nBefore the driver entered the wagon he loosened the horse from the harness and let her walk free. The wagon creaked as he got in beside me. He turned around behind him, lightly brushing against me, as he opened a bag of grain. He scoped out a fist of grain and called his horse, “Dapples, come here girl.”\n\nThe cart horse's head stuck into the wagon and she happily ate the grain from the driver's hand.\n\n“I hope you don’t mind her joining us.” He said with a grin while rubbing the horse's muzzle.\n\nThe driver lowered his hood and I found myself staring as I recognized him. His hair was long, light and slightly tangled from being under the thick woolen hood and his eyes were dark green. My heart couldn't believe the luck that I had stumbled upon him again.\n\n“We certainly weren’t expecting this weather today. Dapples and I were just picking up some grain to bring to the mill.”\n\n“Are you... the miller?” I asked since I remember the miller in the neighboring village being much older.\n\n“Not exactly. Or well. I work the mill now that my father passed. I am the miller's son.” He was quiet for a moment and fiddled with the reins. “I guess that makes me the miller now.” He looked at me with a sad smile.\n\n“I’m so sorry about your father.” I mumbled, looking at my hands.\n\nWe sat in silence for a while, shoulder to shoulder, melting snow dripping from our cloaks and our breaths were smoking from the cold. I wanted to ask a thousand questions, but I couldn't bring myself to do it when I saw the hurt look in his eyes. But maybe that was exactly what I should have done.\n\n“Your father must have meant a lot.”\n\n“He was a rough man as millers go, but he did have a good heart. I left my life as a brewer to come back to the mill when he got ill. The old man deserved no less.” The miller scoffed. “I do miss the brewing business though. It was a breath of new life from the slow, farming labors. But as long as I get to brew some of my special Miller’s Mead, all is well.”\n\nHe smiled slightly, then he caught sight of the acorn necklace hanging around my neck.___NEWPAGE___",
	"lore-miller-piece5": "“That necklace...” He paused.\n\nWhen I realized, my cheeks blushed and I cursed myself that I still had it, although now I am very glad I kept it. I stammered: “I...I found it by…”\n\n“The ponds in the forest.” He said slowly and looked curiously at me.\n\n“I actually saw you there.” I quickly confessed. “And I...” I started fiddling with the knot of the necklace.\n\nHe put up his hand in the air to stop me before I could take it off.\n\n“Please, keep it.” He laughed heartily and gently pet Dapples, who was standing half asleep. “Now, where to? Let me drive you. The storm doesn’t seem to be letting up.” He backed up his horse and hopped out of the wagon.\n\n“That’s very kind. But I need to bring the firewood home.” I excused myself.\n\n“Dapples might be an old mare, but she doesn't mind a little bit of extra cargo.” The miller winked, and refastened Dapples to the wagon, and proceeded to load the firewood. I felt a bit overwhelmed by this kindness and quickly sprung to my feet to help him, saying thank you again and again.___NEWPAGE___",
	"lore-miller-piece6": "We got into the carriage, our clothes completely covered in snow. The miller asked his horse to move forward in a slow trot. Despite the cold, I found the wintery landscape delightful. The snowflakes tickling the skin of my face and the fresh bite in the air. Come to think of it, it is probably winter on the surface now. If there only was a way to feel the snow again.\n\nI had a piece of parchment in the pocket of my skirt which I used to make a sketch of Dapples trudging through the snow. The miller glanced at the paper and I shyly showed him the drawing. His eyes brightened.\n\n“Beautiful. In a way it’s like... a poem without words, isn’t it? I… I used to write poems.”\n\nHe slowed down Dapples at a sharp turn in the road.\n\n“I saw you writing something, when I saw you there, at the pond.” I remarked, folding the parchment again and then pulling the cloak tighter around me.\n\n“That was the first time I wrote after many years of not writing at all.” He noticed the curious spark in my eyes.” I know what you are thinking. It has been a long time since I wrote something worth reading. I could not bore you with my nonsense.”\n\nHe seemed a bit embarrassed so I left it at that. Perhaps he had never shared these things with anyone before.\n\n“If you say so. Another time then.” We briefly looked at each other, smiling shyly.\n\nWe rode off down the road as the snowstorm seemed to be waning. My skin was cold, but  I felt warm on the inside all the way home. His presence made me feel so comfortable and safe in a way I had not felt before.___NEWPAGE___",
	"lore-miller-piece7": "The Mill\n\nIn early spring when it was almost time to sow the rye I was herding my family's three cows through the woods of the neighboring town. I had my cowherd staff, guiding them through the trees, letting them eat off the sparse, sprouting grass that was growing there.\n\nI stood leaning on my staff, looking out over the town below, seeing the townsfolk going about their business. Smoke was rising from the cottages, the sweet smell of fresh bread wafted through the air, and the white sails of the mill were cheerfully spinning in the bright sky.\n\nFrom a distance I saw the miller carrying sacks of grain from a wagon into the mill. He was moving vigorously, not stopping to take a break. He greeted some townsfolk on their way into town and then moved the horse and cart out of the way before he disappeared into the mill.\n\nI was awoken from my daydream, hearing the cows from a distance. The three of them were heading out on the fields. With hurried steps I went out after them but alas they were full of spring energy and cheekiness and just kept running ahead of me. Remembering this now, as I sit here in the cold mountain, I realize how much I really loved those animals, even when they were that naughty.\n\nThey were stopped by a ditch between the mill and the field and I finally got to them. I got in between them and tried to turn them but ended up startling them. One by one they scrambled down and through the ditch to the other side, pushing me off balance and shoving me into the mud. I can still remember the taste and the awful feeling of my feet sinking.___NEWPAGE___",
	"lore-miller-piece8": "I saw the cheeky heifers running, skipping, and leaping along, headed to the bright green, sunkissed grass on the hill by the mill. Desperately I tried to group them together but at this point they were all way too mischievous. They ended up scattering, one of them stomping in through the door of the mill. I was staring in disbelief. There was a commotion, the sound of crashing wood, and a cloud of flour flying out the door quickly followed by a ghostly looking cow covered in white flour, bellowing and coughing.\n\nOut from the settling flour stumbled the miller with a wooden shovel in hand and dusty sleeves rolled up to the elbows, swearing, “Damned cow, where did you come from? Shoo!”\n\nHe hesitated when he noticed me and looked me up and down. “Please, herd your animals somewhere not near the mill.”\n\n“They got away and...” I started, flustered.\n\nHe chuckled and raised an eyebrow when he recognized me. “So you are having a bad day as well aye... cowherdess?” He laughed and brushed the flour off his chest. “Last time we met in a snowstorm, now you brought cow mayhem and took a mud bath.” He put the small, wooden shovel on his shoulder.\n\n“Your four legged friend here knocked down two sacks of spelt flour and knocked the lever from the wooden axle. Jammed it completely...”\n\nThe sails of the mill made a pleasant low, muffled sound as we stood looking at each other. I need not to say that I was beyond embarrassed at that point, just hopelessly standing there, messy, cold, and without cows. But his smile comforted me and ensured that he wasn't too mad.\n\n“The mill will be fine. The brakes are on. Let me help you gather your wild animals.” He looked slightly amused as he grabbed a rope from the wall in the mill.___NEWPAGE___",
	"lore-miller-piece9": "We managed to gather the cows into the horse pasture nearby. He noticed I was shivering from the cold, wet clothes I was wearing so he brought me inside the sparsely lit mill. It was quite loud inside from the wooden machinery still spinning.\n\n“We had dairy cows when I was little” He mentioned, looking at me, understanding. “They always got into trouble. Can't live with them and can't live without them” He put his thick woolen mantle around my shoulders when I sat down. It was still warm from his body. The hood was too big and messed up my hair. He lightly brushed a lock out of my eyes.\n\nHe grabbed a wooden hammer and started working on the dislocated machinery. I kept stealing glances at him as he worked. “You are staring.” He mumbled looking back at me. “Come and help me instead.”\n\nWe managed to get the mill's machinery in working order again and the Miller declared he needed a drink. He proudly brought out a jug of his home brewed Miller’s Mead that we shared. It was delicious, a rich taste of honey, hops, grain, and spices. Fit for a noble! Sadly, I doubt I will ever get to taste it again.\n\nThe alcohol soon turned our slightly awkward talk into soft hearted banter. I asked him about his poems that he had mentioned on our last encounter and after much persuasion he brought out a couple that he had written.___NEWPAGE___",
	"lore-miller-piece10": "A slight bit of nervousness showed in his eyes when he told me that no one else had heard them before and he ran his hand through his hair several times as he started reading out loud.\n\n“I like how they describe little details in life in such a simple but beautiful way.” I said as he took a brief pause. He seemed relieved to hear this and regained his courage to keep reciting.\n\n“You might recognize this one.” He said softly, looking at me and shared his words as he had memorized.\n\nAcorn on a string. Isn't it a delightful thing?\nA great oak tree born from a small seed.\nGrowing slowly but steadily.\nSilently saying, ”This is but all I need.”\nI carry this one acorn with me.\nIt reminds me of what small things hold.\nAnd thus it makes me stronger and bold.\n\nI brought out the acorn that was still hanging around my neck. The miller nodded silently.\n\n“I would like to see you again soon. There are so many odd rumors going on out in the villages.” He said and pulled me into a light, warm hug. “And I really don’t mind taking care of you, cowherdess.”\n\n“I’m sure they are just rumors.” I said blushing. And oh, how wrong I was saying that.\n\nThat sunny spring day was the last time I ever saw the miller. Only a week after we had met in the mill, the gathering and evacuation of villagers and townsfolk started. I so dearly hope that the miller is safe in a shelter like I am, so that we might have a chance of finding each other again when all this is over. If ever. I still have that acorn, hanging close to my heart. It reminds me of what I have lost, but it also it gives me hope. However slight it may be.",

	"lore-inmemoriam-piece1": "Dear F—\n\nI made it.\n\nYou’d be proud of me.\n\nYou were right that all the high and mighties had their secret doctors, their private alchemists, their secluded little hideaway where they’d get better without us riffraff clamoring at the gates for help. Getting in was easier than I’d expected. I found a dead noble and his attendants on the way, and with that rich clothing, no one questioned my arrival, appearance, or admittance.\n\nI’m sat now in the waiting area writing in the journal the dead nobleman had on him. They have brought me water that tastes stale, but no bread and no wine. I expect a meal is coming soon, but do not want to seem impatient. I must be confident.\n\nThe door to the outside is locked with a key that the head of the guards keeps on her belt. I see no other upper-class ladies or gents, just guards, attendants, and a greasy cook who rolled his eyes when I mentioned food. I think I hear moans in the distance. Sick attendants, I am sure.\n\nAh, here they come. I must attend, myself, to acting the part.\n\nIn memoriam,\n\nA—___NEWPAGE___Dear F—\n\nThey took everything of value from me. Yes, I had relieved those riches from a corpse only days ago, but still, it is the principle of the thing. The truth is, they treat me as more a prisoner than their better. After they robbed me, they handed me a mask, gloves, and a cloak, then led me down several flights of stairs to an underground room that looked well-used by the guards. Several played cards around a table, not even looking up as I was led by them.\n\nWe stopped before a trapdoor that led into darkness. There was no ladder. They tied a rope around me and lowered me through the hole until I touched the ground far below. \n\nIt felt like they were interring me into my grave. But as my eyes adjusted, I realized it wasn’t dark, just very dim. A very low fire burned in one corner of the room, and tall, slow-burning candles gave off the barest amount of light. And in that light huddled people who still sat stiffly, as if at court instead of deep in the earth. \n\nStill, they look healthy. And despite the guards taking the goods I had, I’ve known many rich people more determined to hold onto their treasure than the poorest beggar with a scrap of bread. \n\nI’m a fox in the henhouse. I’ll survive this plague yet, and be the better for it.\n\n In memoriam,\n\nA—___NEWPAGE___Dearest F—\n\nBefore the Rot took your mouth, you said it was madness to come here, if the rumors of a lazaret for the nobility were even true. I argued that there was no better place to be at the end of the world than with those who have money and power.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nWe are all masked, every inch of skin covered with fabric. Any weakness invites bullying, and though I’m strong and untouched by the Rot, the others here are desperate as rats caught in a trap.\n\nThere’s a pit where they throw the dead and the dying. Of course, we are all dying. The pit was meant for our bodily waste, but now is a hole for those too weak to resist, just so those left can have a greater share of the food, the undivided service of the servants condemned here with us, or whatever treasures the dying had smuggled in with the vain hope they’d be able to buy their way back to power in the new world.\n\nI’ve resigned myself to it. There is no new world for any of us.\n\nIn memoriam,\n\nA—___NEWPAGE___F—\n\nI pushed a woman into the pit.\n\nShe wasn’t even very sick, but I noticed she’d been cagey about her stone bed and the crevices carved into the wall she’d claimed as her own. The woman had gold and silver jewelry there smeared with dirt to lessen their shine and blanketed with a scrap of cloth. Not only that, she was hoarding food.\n\nFor days, I watched as she nibbled her rations and stored the rest away as though planting seeds for later harvest. When the rest of us quieted down as though practicing for death, she would decorate herself with rings and necklaces.\n\nShe refused any help from the servants, out of fear they would find her out and take what she’d held onto for so long. This meant she was responsible for throwing away her own waste, which she did also in the dead of night when all others were sleeping.\n\nI walked up quietly behind her, but she must have heard me for she turned at the last moment, her eyes wide with shock through the holes in her mask. She tried to fight me off, but a firm push with both hands sent her falling, all without a sound.\n\nMy fingers pressed into her flesh like it was rotten fruit, my gloves smeared with black. I tossed the gloves into the pit, too. I have her food. I have her jewelry. I have her bed.\n\nIn memoriam,\n\nA—___NEWPAGE___F—\n\nI have the rot. It was that woman, damn her.\n\nThough I take all the medicine the guards send down to us, I fear it does nothing. My right hand is dark with Rot and numb, smearing any surface I touch.\n\nI will survive, though. I will do it, I swear. The Rot works on the spirit as well as the flesh, and I may lose myself before I recover. In case my memory becomes splotched like a rotten apple, I’m leaving this journal with the treasures I've gathered and all the extra food. I grow less and less hungry, but know I will need every bit of it after I fight off this sickness.\n\nThe others eye me with envy and suspicion. I avoid going near the pit. I can still hear the woman crying for help from the bottom of it.\n\nIn memoriam,\n\nA—",

Calling for help if something goes wrong, or at the very least helping us find out what happened later.",
	"dialogue-resonator-letmeclarify": "Well, let me clarify: The sound isn't exactly written down on the cylinder. We tried that route, but the sound always got muddled. No, what these cylinders do is provide directions. Like a map, they tell the resonator exactly where to find the sound within the Chamber. And with that, the resonator synchronizes with the Chamber to play the sound as though it were right in front of you. No accounting for any issues with the bell's recordings, though.",

	"dialogue-alba-youvegotstyle": "You've got style, I'll admit. But I could make it better.",
	"dialogue-alba-alba": "Alba is my name. Has been ever since I was born.",
	"dialogue-alba-imatailor": "I'm a tailor. I grow my own flax and have plenty of extra seed, in case you want to go the long way towards making clothes yourself.",
	"dialogue-alba-hopeyourenot": "Well, I hope you're not planning on staying. This town has a tailor already.",
	"dialogue-alba-helpafellowtailor": "Good. Though if you want to help a fellow tailor out, I would be willing to pay for flowers, minerals, and such for dyes. There are some colors we just can't get around here.",
	"dialogue-alba-nadiya": "You're in the village of Nadiya. Here we have everything we need, and some things we don't.",
	"dialogue-alba-canthelpyou": "I can't help you with that. Maybe Līga can, at the inn? Or Gerhardt. He's traveled all over. And you could ask Sedna, but she's just as likely to spin you a tale as tell you the truth.",

	"dialogue-kat-wellmet": "Well met, friend. What brings you to Nadiya? Or are you just passing through?",
	"dialogue-kat-traveler": "(Blackguard) Traveler.",
	"dialogue-kat-friendlyadvice": "(Malefactor) A word of friendly advice. Watch yourself. What's your business in Nadiya?",
	"dialogue-kat-justpassingthrough": "I'm just passing through.",
	"dialogue-kat-lookingtostay": "Looking to stay for a while.",
	"dialogue-kat-ineedsupplies": "I need some supplies. Is anyone selling?",
	"dialogue-kat-letter": "I'm looking for whoever wrote this.",
	"dialogue-kat-ourvillage": "Our village is a quiet one. Just the way I like it.",
	"dialogue-kat-fineenough": "Fine enough. Take a look around.",
	"dialogue-kat-findaroom": "You might find a room at the inn. Beds there for a fair price.",
	"dialogue-kat-kat": "It's Kat.",
	"dialogue-kat-guard": "I know it's hard to tell from my livery and weapons, but you'll just have to take my word for it that I'm a guard. The captain of the guard, in fact.",
	"dialogue-kat-peaceful": "Peaceful, and we'd like to keep it that way. We manage comfort and safety out here, but it's a delicate thing. We don't appreciate trouble.",
	"dialogue-kat-meansnothingtome": "That letter means nothing to me, but feel free to ask around. People will tell you what they wish. If you're friendly, they'll be friendly back.",
	"dialogue-kat-agnieszka": "Agnieszka probably has extra armor and weapons, and can repair what you have, too. If you're sick, talk to Wall. Most people here have something to sell if you have the money.",
	"dialogue-kat-advice": "Thank you for the advice. I'll look around.",

	"dialogue-liga-welcome": "Welcome to Nadiya. What can I offer you?",
	"dialogue-liga-getaroom": "Can I get a room here?",
	"dialogue-liga-letter": "I'm looking for someone who can tell me about this letter.",
	"dialogue-liga-tobias": "Can you tell me anything more about Saint Tobias?",
	"dialogue-liga-nohurry": "I see you're in no hurry. Somewhat like my husband.",
	"dialogue-liga-liga": "I respond to Līga. Sometimes to “Hey you.” Sometimes to “I'm hungry.”",
	"dialogue-liga-whatdoyouneed": "What do you need me to do? I can get you a room to stay, if you wish, and we sell food and drink. We have a great local cheese. And I also know what's going on in the village. What are you looking to do?",
	"dialogue-liga-rest": "Just rest and resupply.",
	"dialogue-liga-information": "I need information.",
	"dialogue-liga-lookingaround": "I'm only looking around.",
	"dialogue-liga-wehaveenough": "Ah, well. We don't have a lot, but we have enough. If you need metalwork of any kind, you couldn't do better than Agnieszka. Her forge is impossible to miss. If you're injured or need salves for the itch, see Tad or Wall. Alba can help you with new clothes. Gerhardt can sell you fresh meat or furs. And Sedna, a musician who blesses us with her company, well, she has a voice like a songbird. Nothing more restful, if you ask me.",
	"dialogue-liga-knowthings": "If you're looking to know things, first, don't talk to my husband. You'll end up knowing less every time he opens his mouth. Sedna the musician knows more about history and folklore than all of us put together. Talk to her, or just listen to her songs for a bit. You'll learn a lot. If it's more immediate information you want, go see the hunter, Gerhardt. He lost his wife recently, so be considerate, but he can give you the lay of the land around the village. He's the only one who travels, really. If you're looking to avoid danger - or find it, I won't judge - then go talk to him.",
	"dialogue-liga-feelfree": "Feel free, feel free. We're a friendly village, but we keep our eyes open. Treat us well, and we'll do the same to you.",
	"dialogue-liga-nadiya": "This is Nadiya. I'm not surprised you don't know it. Traders and travelers come by occasionally. We're friendly, though. Talk to some people and you'll see.",
	"dialogue-liga-sorry": "Sorry, we're all full up at the moment. Give us a couple weeks and we should have vacancies.",
	"dialogue-liga-veryinteresting": "This, ah, this is very interesting. This letter is old! Perhaps old enough. Years ago Saint Tobias, or a man using his name, paid a number of villagers to take letters like this to places all over. Is this one of those letters? I don't know. See that statue outside in the village square? That's Saint Tobias. He was real, regardless of what you might hear elsewhere, and he helped found this town. But he has got to be long dead now. No one lives forever.",
	"dialogue-liga-sednaknows": "Me? No. Sedna surely knows the tales about him. Agnieszka and Gerhardt both deal with people outside the village, so maybe they know more. But as I said, he's likely long dead. Do you want to waste your life chasing after a ghost?",

	"dialogue-sedna-commoner": "(Commoner) Now you must have quite the story.",
	"dialogue-sedna-hunter": "(Hunter) I see the sharpness in your eyes.",
	"dialogue-sedna-malefactor": "(Malefactor) You wouldn't be hiding something, would you? Tell me or not, I know how to keep a secret.",
	"dialogue-sedna-clockmaker": "(Clockmaker) You can see it all turning, can't you?",
	"dialogue-sedna-blackguard": "(Blackguard) Let me guess. You solve problems. Or create them.",
	"dialogue-sedna-tailor": "(Tailor) Your hands are fine and slender. Do you play an instrument?",
	"dialogue-sedna-unknownclass": "({{characterclass}})You must be new around here.",
	"dialogue-sedna-anythingtosell": "Do you have anything to sell?",
	"dialogue-sedna-whatdoyoubuy": "Well, what do you buy then?",
	"dialogue-sedna-ihavestories": "I have stories you might want.",
	"dialogue-sedna-letter": "I'm looking for someone who might've written this letter.",
	"dialogue-sedna-tobias": "Can you tell me anything about Saint Tobias?",
	"dialogue-sedna-anystories": "Any song-worthy stories for me?",
	"dialogue-sedna-sedna": "I am Sedna the Melodic, the Lark of the Hills, the Echo of the Depths, the traveling musician and source of news from distant shores, stories both true and false, all entertaining.",
	"dialogue-sedna-obvious": "Isn't it obvious? Hmm... maybe it's my clothing. Too plain? Or maybe it's my humble way of speaking? I am, of course, a musician. I sing songs and can play music on any instrument, no matter how decrepit.",
	"dialogue-sedna-nadiya": "Nadiya is a village like any other. It is better, perhaps, than most, and worse, undoubtedly, than others.",
	"dialogue-sedna-accuseme": "Sell? You dare accuse me of commerce? I give away music for free, and take what offerings people give as donations to the furtherance of my art. I am willing to buy things, however.",
	"dialogue-sedna-books": "Books, scrolls, letters. I'm looking for stories I haven't heard before, especially those that come from the old world.",
	"dialogue-sedna-seenbefore": "I've seen letters like this before in my travels. Sometimes in people's hands, and other times in ruins. Sometimes in people's dead and ruined hands.",
	"dialogue-sedna-connected": "I have heard they're connected to Saint Tobias, but all folktales are measured only by the beauty of the voice that sings them. In any case, they're written in an old tongue and not easily translated.",
	"dialogue-sedna-pullupachair": "Is that so? Well pull up a chair, let's hear it.",
	"dialogue-sedna-archives": "I have seen the great Resonance Archives firsthand.",
	"dialogue-sedna-allivegot": "That's all I've got for now.",
	"dialogue-sedna-verywell": "Very well. Anything else you need?",
	"dialogue-sedna-archiveswhat": "The Resonance Archives? I've never heard of such a place. What was it like?",
	"dialogue-sedna-massiveunderground": "A massive underground structure, full of dreadful machinery that came to life and attacked me!",
	"dialogue-sedna-hauntinglybeautiful": "A hauntingly beautiful grave. It was clearly important at some point, but now it's nothing but ruins and ghosts.",
	"dialogue-sedna-bastionofknowledge": "Incredible. A true bastion of knowledge, seemingly built to house and protect an ancient library.",
	"dialogue-sedna-storyneedsaction": "I see. And what did you do while you were there? A story needs action.",
	"dialogue-sedna-metalgiant": "I faced a raging metal giant in a duel. It almost brought the whole cavern down around us, but I defeated it.",
	"dialogue-sedna-lootedtheplace": "I looted the place for all it was worth and then escaped before my supplies ran out.",
	"dialogue-sedna-despitethedanger": "Despite the danger, I found myself reading in the library. I couldn't stop my curiousity.",
	"dialogue-sedna-howdashing": "Oh, how dashing! You have a flair for drama. I'll be sure to capture your heroic spirit and, dare I say, fine silhouette when I've composed a song about this.",
	"dialogue-sedna-thrillingheist": "So it was a thrilling heist! I can see it now: A bold dive into the darkness, getting in and getting out before the cursed ones even know you're there.",
	"dialogue-sedna-subtlerapproach": "Hmm, I can work with that. A subtler approach. A story about a lost world and the need for knowledge that drives us forward.",
	"dialogue-sedna-fascinatingtale": "It will be a fascinating tale, to be sure. Thank you for giving the inspiration. Here's something for your efforts.",
	"dialogue-sedna-wiseman": "He was wise man from the dark days of yore. It's said he could command angels to do his bidding. Here in Nadiya, they consider him their patron and it's believed he helped build this village long ago. But many villages have their own stories about him or the other saints.",

	"dialogue-tad-uncurable": "Oh dear, I'm afraid it's uncurable!",
	"dialogue-tad-haircut": "Can you give me a haircut?",
	"dialogue-tad-heal": "Can you treat my wounds?",
	"dialogue-tad-happyto": "I would be happy to! It'll cost you a gear.",
	"dialogue-tad-firsttreatment": "I've always wanted a chance to examine one of the seraphim! This first treatment won't cost a thing. Shall we begin?",
	"dialogue-tad-pleaseheal": "Please heal my wounds.",
	"dialogue-tad-nevermind": "Nevermind, I'll come back later.",
	"dialogue-tad-gearheal": "Alright, here's one gear. Please heal my wounds.",
	"dialogue-tad-onlyamoment": "Very well, this should take only a moment.",
	"dialogue-tad-mostlyfine": "All finished! Everything seems mostly fine!",
	"dialogue-tad-letter": "I'm looking for someone who might have written this.",
	"dialogue-tad-welcome": "Welcome, traveler. Rough time on the road?",
	"dialogue-tad-tad": "Tad is my name, but friends call me Tad. Call me Barber Surgeon, if you wish. Just don't call me Barbara.",
	"dialogue-tad-tadtad": "Tad?",
	"dialogue-tad-barbersurgeon": "Barber Surgeon?",
	"dialogue-tad-barbara": "Barbara?",
	"dialogue-tad-friendscallme": "That's what my friends call me. So I guess we're friends now.",
	"dialogue-tad-faceless": "Some patients feel better being cared for by a faceless professional. If that's you, then Barber Surgeon is me.",
	"dialogue-tad-notabadname": "Actually, that's not a bad name. Call me Barbara, then.",
	"dialogue-tad-imabarber": "I'm a barber surgeon! Your best friend until you die! Of course, once you die, you don't have friends and I can't help you there. Until you die, though, I can sew up your wounds, set broken bones, pull rotting teeth, and even cut your hair.",
	"dialogue-tad-nadiya": "You have found yourself in Nadiya, the greatest bastion of civilization within a decent walking distance!",
	"dialogue-tad-certainlymysterious": "Yes, yes, letters like this one are certainly mysterious. Often relics from the past that have no bearing on the present. When I was apprenticing to be a barber surgeon, I heard many tales of such letters and documents and books being found. Most were too degraded to be of any use, and those that weren't often spoke of things incomprehensible or out of date. Your letter looks more recent. Perhaps Sedna, our traveling musician, or Gerhardt the hunter could help?",

	"dialogue-wall-anotherdistraction": "Ah, yes, another distraction. Is there something you need?",
	"dialogue-wall-letter": "I'm looking for someone who can tell me about this letter.",
	"dialogue-wall-leadintogold": "I'm still no closer to turning lead into gold. What about you?",
	"dialogue-wall-wall": "People call me Wall.",
	"dialogue-wall-collectherbs": "I collect herbs. I brew them. I give the resulting concoctions to those in need. I also dabble in alchemy.",
	"dialogue-wall-nadiya": "Nadiya is a fair enough village. We protect each other as well as we can.",
	"dialogue-wall-plantsoralchemy": "If it doesn't concern plants or alchemy, then it does not concern me. Go bother someone else.",

	"dialogue-arzhur-welcome": "Hello traveler! Welcome to our humble village.",
	"dialogue-arzhur-goodtoseeyou": "Good to see you again. What can I do for ya?",
	"dialogue-arzhur-gotabed": "Got a bed I could rent?",
	"dialogue-arzhur-letter": "I'm looking for someone who can tell me about this letter.",
	"dialogue-arzhur-arzhur": "Name's Arzhur. Good to meet you!",
	"dialogue-arzhur-runtheinn": "I run the inn here with my wife, Līga. If you're looking for information, she's better at that sort of thing than I am.",
	"dialogue-arzhur-iwouldntknow": "Hmm sorry, I wouldn't know anything about that. I keep focus on two things: good food and good mead. Well, and good customers too of course!",
	"dialogue-arzhur-sorry": "Sorry friend, all our rooms are taken for the next little while. Hopefully we'll have a bed for you next time you visit. You're welcome to spend the night on the floor, though. Maybe after one too many jugs of mead, eh?",

	"dialogue-tobias-donttakevisitors": "I don't take visitors. Why do you think I live in this water-logged hole in the-",
	"dialogue-tobias-godsbones": "God's bones, you're actually here!",
	"dialogue-tobias-youlookdifferent": "And you look... different. I suppose some changes should be expected.",
	"dialogue-tobias-areyousainttobias": "Are you Saint Tobias? The one who sent all those messages?",
	"dialogue-tobias-youdontremember": "You don't remember me? Hmm, another unexpected consequence.",
	"dialogue-tobias-shouldiremember": "Should I remember you?",
	"dialogue-tobias-ishouldthinkso": "I should think so. We've been through hell together and came out the other side. Though some of us took longer than others.",
	"dialogue-tobias-dropthesaint": "In any case, drop the 'Saint' part. It's just Tobias.",
	"dialogue-tobias-haveyoubrought": "We've much to discuss, but first I must know: Have you brought the Lens with you?",
	"dialogue-tobias-ivegotit": "It wasn't easy, but I've got it. (Hand over The Lens.)",
	"dialogue-tobias-noididnt": "Uh, no I didn't.",
	"dialogue-tobias-overfivecenturies": "It's been... over five centuries since I first saw him use this. I was young, then. We both were. A mere farmhand and a lord's son in his father's library. By that point he had already turned the room into his own workshop...",
	"dialogue-tobias-thoughtswellup": "(Tobias looks back up.) Sorry, the thoughts well up on their own from time to time.",
	"dialogue-tobias-briefhopeflickers": "Thank you, my friend. With this, the brief hope flickers on for a time longer. Though it always seems to come at great cost. I am sorry to have put you through that. But as it was worth the sacrifice to bring you here, in time I will show you this prize was worth your efforts.",
	"dialogue-tobias-didntgetmyletter": "(Tobias frowns.) Hmm, you didn't get my letter? Perhaps those villagers have forgotten about me after all these years.",
	"dialogue-tobias-vitallyimportant": "Nevermind. Listen, it's good youre here but it's vitally important that we have the Lens if this new world is going to continue. I would retrieve it myself, but as you can see there is simply no way I could manage the task.",
	"dialogue-tobias-playthetaskmaster": "I'm sorry, friend. I don't wish to play the taskmaster again, but this must be done. Rest here for a time, take what supplies you need, then you must be on your way to the blasted lands and the tower that waits there. We can speak more after that.",
	"dialogue-tobias-byyourface": "By your face, I can see this is the first you've heard of this. Well, suffice it to say bringing you back here had a cost and that cost was paid some distance from here. Here is a map to get there. When you're there, you should see a great tower, or what remains of one. Within it, you will find the Lens, that great, first instrument of Jonas himself. Retrieve it for me, I beg of you. I will explain all afterwards.",
	"dialogue-tobias-dearwingedbeast": "And if you should see my dear winged beast out there, luck be with you.",
	"dialogue-tobias-youreback": "Ah, you're back. What is it?",
	"dialogue-tobias-supposedtodo": "What was I supposed to do again?",
	"dialogue-tobias-givelens": "Okay, I brought it. (Give Tobias The Lens)",
	"dialogue-tobias-whatislens": "What is the Lens?",
	"dialogue-tobias-whatwasdevastation": "What was going on back there in the Devastation?",
	"dialogue-tobias-knowninnadiya": "You're quite well known in Nadiya.",
	"dialogue-tobias-whatwaslazaret": "What was that Lazaret place?",
	"dialogue-tobias-whataboutme": "What can you tell me about... me?",
	"dialogue-tobias-whathappensnow": "So what happens now?",
	"dialogue-tobias-rotaddlemind": "What, did the Rot addle your mind as well? You must travel to The Devastation, climb the tower there, and retrieve The Lens from its highest point. Do this and I will see you are rewarded for your efforts. Here, another map in case you've lost it.",
	"dialogue-tobias-illgodothat": "Okay, I'll go do that.",
	"dialogue-tobias-goodluck": "Good luck.",
	"dialogue-tobias-thefirstdevice": "It is the first. The first true device he ever made. And from it like a wellspring all the other miracles come forth.",
	"dialogue-tobias-whatisittruly": "But what is it truly? What does it do?",
	"dialogue-tobias-whywasthisworth": "Why was this worth my struggles?",
	"dialogue-tobias-whatdoyouintend": "What do you intend to do with it?",
	"dialogue-tobias-ithinkiunderstand": "I think I understand.",
	"dialogue-tobias-indeedalens": "It is indeed a lens. Or perhaps, in a simpler metaphor, it is a window. The slightest window to another place. Another time. We cannot step through, not yet, but one can peer. Peer through and see the strange, inconceivable landscape. The towers, the sheer edges, the metallic, rumbling beasts shifting and moving like clockwork. From there, he stole inspiration. He learned how to use the flux. How to simulate what he had seen. How to change the world.",
	"dialogue-tobias-ihavepeeredthrough": "I have peered through it myself. The lens is clouded. Dirty. And that world beyond is dark and dreadful. In his time, Jonas said it shone like gemstones.",
	"dialogue-tobias-werequireinformation": "We require information, you and I. I know more than you, perhaps, but not enough. Of all the knowledge I have gathered over these centuries, one thing haunts me the most. Our enemy is not finished. It comes for us again. Comes to eat the rest of me and the dream we've realized.",
	"dialogue-tobias-therotmyfriend": "The Rot, my friend. The Rot returns. And these paltry survivors are not prepared. Even if they were, I suspect our past endeavor could not, should not, be replicated.",
	"dialogue-tobias-manyyearssearching": "I spent many years searching for the Lens. Many cold, dark years under the surface and amongst the wreckage. I am no prodigy of science. Much of my life since the old days has been spent tracing what came to Jonas naturally. In the Lens, I lean on him once more. I used it to bring you here. Now we will use it to go beyond.",
	"dialogue-tobias-theorizedandresearched": "I have theorized and researched much in this dark hovel of mine. With the Lens, we might put such science into action. There is still more work to be done before it is ready, but I intend to reach beyond where even Jonas gazed. And when the time comes, I will need your help again. Your... unique biology, or perhaps lack thereof, will prove vital to our efforts I think.",
	"dialogue-tobias-whenjonasfirstbegan": "When Jonas first began his works, he did so with a kind heart and a warm dream. We do not have such luxuries anymore. What we do now, we do because we must.",
	"dialogue-tobias-sorryaboutallthat": "Ah, sorry about all that. I wish it didn't have to happen, but tearing a hole in the world is no simple feat.",
	"dialogue-tobias-toreahole": "You tore a hole in the world?",
	"dialogue-tobias-whatwastower": "What was that tower?",
	"dialogue-tobias-whatwasmonster": "What was that monster?",
	"dialogue-tobias-isee": "I see.",
	"dialogue-tobias-whyyouawoke": "Indeed. Have you wondered why you awoke again after all this time? I awoke alone in that dreadful Lazaret. Everyone was gone. The world had shifted. It took me many years to ascertain what happened. Jonas was no help at all. From what I understand, when our grand machine awoke everything was changed. Those who were nearby were lost or worse. You and your fellows were lost beyond time. Beyond this world. I needed your help, and so I poked a hole that you might leak back through eventually. A desperate gamble, but it paid off.",
	"dialogue-tobias-thegreatsorceror": "(Tobias gives a theatrical flourish) In short, you have been summoned by the great sorcerer.",
	"dialogue-tobias-lifelongproject": "A lifelong project, for most. My companions and I built it over many years. Alas, many of them did not live to see it pierce the firmament, but that ruin is proof of their mettle. We succeeded in our task and in doing so forever destroyed that dear tower and the lands around it. Such is the cost of miracles.",
	"dialogue-tobias-belovedchild": "A beloved child. Now I understand the dismay he must have felt, seeing his creations grow strange. That is my Erel. A guardian and companion I created to assist our efforts. She was bound to the tower and lost her mind when the Devastation occurred. I grieve for her, but my heart still soars to see her wings in flight.",
	"dialogue-tobias-therewhenfounded": "I should think so, I was there when it was founded.",
	"dialogue-tobias-kindpeople": "They're kind people. Or so I assume. I haven't visited since their grandparents' time.",
	"dialogue-tobias-youwerethere": "You were there when it was founded?",
	"dialogue-tobias-thinkitsbadnow": "You think it's bad now, you should have seen the world in those days. The storms were worse then. And nobody was prepared for the creatures within, let alone the ones peeling out of the rifts.",
	"dialogue-tobias-humanitydoomed": "Humanity seemed doomed to flicker and fade. Another relic of the old world left behind. But we are nothing if not tenacious.",
	"dialogue-tobias-lowlyworm": "In those days I was naught but a lowly worm, crawled loose from the Lazaret. Yet I found a group of stragglers who would aid me. In turn, I told them what I could of building, farming, metallurgy, and the like.",
	"dialogue-tobias-formedanewhome": "In time we had formed a new home. Small, but well-guarded. Like a village elder, they came to me for advice. In exchange, they gave me a place to heal and study the world in peace.",
	"dialogue-tobias-survivejustfine": "Eventually I decided they would survive just fine without me. I took to wandering, learning what I needed to about the world and its new inhabitants.",
	"dialogue-tobias-stillkeepsomecontact": "I still keep some contact with a few souls in Nadiya, but after the Devastation I felt it was best to keep my distance.",
	"dialogue-tobias-trulycursedplace": "(Tobias shakes his head) That was a truly cursed place. Jonas had begged me to travel there and hold on as I could. More than once, I wished I had denied him and taken my life at the onset. When the Rot seeps in deep enough, even that option is lost to you.",
	"dialogue-tobias-inmytorment": "So I laid there in my torment, amongst those too wealthy or too important to simply give the mercy they deserved. I'm sure you've seen the Rot's procession. It slowly ate away my limbs. By the time I could scarcely see the dim candles or the sunlight through the shaft, I knew it had finally reached my head. All I could do was wait for death.",
	"dialogue-tobias-perhapsidid": "And perhaps I did indeed die. I cannot say for sure. Only that I woke up to a terrible rumbling of the earth and found the Rot scoured clean. What was gone remained gone, but I lived.",
	"dialogue-tobias-strangelycoloredskin": "Strangely colored skin. Taller than previously, if I recall correctly. Lack of memory before return. Everything else seems as expected. You're the first I've seen.",
	"dialogue-tobias-allsharesuchfeatures": "I wonder, will they all share such features or is each instance unique?",
	"dialogue-tobias-backatthetower": "Back at the Tower, I was able to shift through time.",
	"dialogue-tobias-expectingothers": "You're expecting others?",
	"dialogue-tobias-didntalwayslook": "I didn't always look like this?",
	"dialogue-tobias-myoldlife": "What about my old life?",
	"dialogue-tobias-youwhat": "You... what?",
	"dialogue-tobias-slipthrough": "I could slip through to the past and see the Tower as it used to be.",
	"dialogue-tobias-simplyunbelievable": "That is... simply unbelievable! And yet, I can see you are not lying. Incredible.",
	"dialogue-tobias-strangekindofsense": "It makes a strange kind of sense, though. If my theory holds true, and given your presence here I believe it does, you and the others were lost beyond our world. Perhaps your time, or lack thereof, spent there has conditioned your body to more easily ignore that which holds the rest of us in place.",
	"dialogue-tobias-fascinatingnews": "This is fascinating news. I shall have to consider it at length, but if we can use this unusual ability to our advantage it may be the key to our success.",
	"dialogue-tobias-deliriousbytheend": "I was delirious by the end, but I believe there were many from the underground who were lost but not perished. In recent years, I've heard tell of strange figures walking the lands. Seraphs, they call you.",
	"dialogue-tobias-truthfromfaerietale": "But without seeing one in person, I couldn't separate truth from faerie tale. There were stories of twelve foot giants, watery ghosts, and eyes made of lightning! Who knows how much of that is rampant rumor or vision addled by the storms? Then again, given what we've seen from you, perhaps we shouldn't rule it out.",
	"dialogue-tobias-normalhumanonce": "Of course not. You were a normal human once. No offense. I'm not exactly normal myself these days either.",
	"dialogue-tobias-verylongtime": "It's been a very long time and my memory isn't as reliable as it once was, but...",
	"dialogue-tobias-blackguard": "(Blackguard) You were a soldier. One of the best and the worst. A blackguard that fought against humanity for the sake of humanity. You and your companions did what was necessary to keep order in the underground and were hated for it. But there were some who respected you for it, myself and Jonas included. We would have failed and perished long ago without your help.",
	"dialogue-tobias-malefactor": "(Malefactor) To be frank, you were a criminal. You never told me of your crime, but in those days we couldn't afford to be just. Your kind was condemned to the surface and only allowed to return if you scavenged something of value. A terrible fate, and terribly cruel. But your resourcefulness was undeniable, and we would all come to be scavengers by the end. For what was done to you, I am sorry. And truly glad to see you have survived to find freedom again.",
	"dialogue-tobias-hunter": "(Hunter) You were one of the hunters. In a world shifting to stone and science, you clung to the old ways. I can't imagine the pain of it. Before we went under, you and yours hunted the life out of the world. Beloved prey, beloved predators, killed or caged for the foodstuffs below. But perhaps it was a kinder farewell than leaving them to the Rot, eh? You were never at peace in the underground, but we would never have survived without your aid.",
	"dialogue-tobias-clockmaker": "(Clockmaker) You were a clockmaker originally, I believe. WIth the rising age of invention, your precision skills became highly sought after. Jonas himself recruited many of you for the Machine project. We even worked together on a few tasks I think, but then there was always so much to do. I'm afraid I was unable to see our project to its completion, but I'm certain you were there at the end, invaluable as ever.",
	"dialogue-tobias-tailor": "(Tailor) You were one of the artisans. A tailor, if I recall correctly. Perhaps it sounds superfluous, looking back on it, but craftsmen of all kinds were essential in those times. For functional purposes, of course, but also to retain what little humanity we held onto. A song in the deeps, a flash of color in the dark. These things kept us alive as much as the food in our stores.",
	"dialogue-tobias-commoner": "(Commoner) Forgive me, but I can't recall what it was you did before the Rot came. It never seemed important to you. There were some like you who found ways to help however they could even without a specialty to offer, thriving in opposition to everything crumbling around them. It was truly inspiring to see.",
	"dialogue-tobias-unknownclass": "({{characterclass}}) Truth to be told, I have no idea. I only ever spoke to you in passing.",

	"dialogue-tobias-alrightalright": "Alright, alright. Maybe less, we'll see. Natural philosophy is a delicate process, you know? You'd be surprised how much work goes into making new bits and bobs, let alone maintaing the old ones!",
	"dialogue-tobias-inthemeantime": "In the meantime, here's something for your efforts: Plans for your very own translocator!",
	"dialogue-tobias-andacomponent": "And a component that will pair it directly to the translocator here. Might save you the trip next time.",
	"dialogue-tobias-perhapsyouvetried": "Perhaps you've tried throwing yourself into one of the translocators out in the wilds? Given your new self, you should be much less likely to hemorrhage, melt, combust, split, scream, or any of the other issues that affected those who tried it back in our time.",
	"dialogue-tobias-giveitseomtime": "That being said, you'll have to give it some time after translocating. I modified Jonas' work to allow for easy pairing over a great distance, but it needs more time to recover its strength after use.",
	"dialogue-tobias-trybuildingthat": "In the meantime, try building that translocator from the schematic I gave you. Should save you the long walk back next time we need to talk.",
	"dialogue-tobias-anyfood": "Tobias, I have travelled far. Do you have any food?",
	"dialogue-tobias-ofcoursefood": "Of course! Here, take a few loaves of bread. Baked just the way I like them.",
	"dialogue-tobias-monsters": "You have monsters here, yet they do not attack you. How is this possible?",
	"dialogue-tobias-hmmonsters": "Hm? Monsters?",
	"dialogue-tobias-automatons": "Ah, you must mean Charlemagne and the other automatons. Don't worry, they're harmless. What's the worst they could do, crush my frail bones into powder?",
	"dialogue-tobias-trustyou": "I will trust you on that.",

	"dialogue-beata-helloagain": "Well hello again! Feeling hungry yet?",
	"dialogue-beata-bread": "I could use some bread.",
	"dialogue-beata-beata": "Oh, silly me. I'm Beata. The baker here.",
	"dialogue-beata-gerhardt": "Not me, I never was much for reading. Try dear old Gerhardt. You can usually find him up tanning hides in the fortress.",

	"dialogue-waclaw-bettertalk": "Better talk with Agnieszka. She doesn't trust me with haggling yet.",
	"dialogue-waclaw-notaclue": "Not a clue. Maybe Agnieszka knows. She gets letters from time to time. Never lets me read them.",

	"dialogue-piotr-welcome": "Welcome. Don't mind Kat, she's gotta put on a tough front for the newcomers.",
	"dialogue-piotr-welcomeback": "Enjoying your time in Nadiya?",
	"dialogue-piotr-trouble": "Do you get a lot of trouble here?",
	"dialogue-piotr-piotr": "I'm Piotr. Part of the guard around here.",
	"dialogue-piotr-yesandno": "Well, yes and no. We Nadiyans are tough, but nobody get any work done if they have to constantly keep an eye out for the cursed ones. So Kat and the rest of us keep watch day and night. You know, protecting those who work the fields. Keeping things from getting inside the walls.",
	"dialogue-piotr-pause": "(He pauses)",
	"dialogue-piotr-bad": "It can get bad. We've got our walls and our weapons, but the bastards are ruthless. We lose people. Something might climb over in the night. Sometimes there are too many. Or you just make a mistake and someone pays for it.",
	"dialogue-piotr-sorry": "I'm sorry to hear that.",
	"dialogue-piotr-pride": "It's alright. I take pride in what I do, and the others know we're doing everything we can.",
	"dialogue-piotr-blackguard": "(Blackguard) We all do what we can.",

	"dialogue-norbert-welcome": "Ah! Hello. Come on in from the wilderness.",
	"dialogue-norbert-welcomeback": "Another day of living, eh?",
	"dialogue-norbert-norbert": "Just call me Norbert. A humble farmer.",
	"dialogue-norbert-longtime": "It's been a long, long time. When I was a child, I had an uncle. An adventurous sort. Never seemed comfortable here. One day a trader came to town with a message from Saint Tobias himself, or so he said. According to this trader, Saint Tobias was looking for volunteers to deliver his words across the land.",
	"dialogue-norbert-gears": "The trader offered more gears than I'd ever seen in exchange for this simple task. I remember my father begging him to stay, but my uncle took those missives without a second thought. They looked much like the one you're holding there. I never saw him again.",
	"dialogue-norbert-badnews": "I couldn't say for sure that it was him, but I have some bad news.",
	"dialogue-norbert-allwell": "No, no, it's all well. I had always hoped he was off gallivanting somewhere, but even so his time would have come by now. If anything, it's a relief to see that he did what he set out to do. I don't know much about Saint Tobias, and I know even less about your kind, but I know that something greater than ourselves is afoot and my uncle played his part, just as we play ours.",
	"dialogue-norbert-agnieszka": "Please take that letter to Agnieszka. She often gets letters from outsiders. Commissions, I assume. But I've often suspected there is more to it than that. She'll listen to what you have to say.",

	"dialogue-indira-welcome": "You must be new here. Please, rest easy. You're safe.",
	"dialogue-indira-welcomeback": "Doing well, I hope?",
	"dialogue-indira-worried": "Are you worried about working outside the walls?",
	"dialogue-indira-indira": "My name is Indira. I work the fields.",
	"dialogue-indira-ofcourse": "Of course, it's hard to be completely at peace out here. But we know there's usually someone keeping watch for us. And that's a comforting thought, having the village at our backs.",
	"dialogue-indira-storms": "What about the storms?",
	"dialogue-indira-truestorm": "The true storm? We all make our stand together when it comes. That old fortress up the hill has kept us safe for generations. The cursed ones in their revelry make what havoc they can, but they usually leave the crops alone. Same with the livestock.",
	"dialogue-indira-livestock": "Best to keep the livestock out of the fortress anyway. Don't mention this to Lena, but I don't trust those beasts in the storm.",
	"dialogue-indira-noclue": "Haven't a clue. I keep my hands in the soil. No time for reading and writing.",

	"dialogue-laura-welcome": "Blue skies, traveler.",
	"dialogue-laura-welcomeback": "Still here, are you?",
	"dialogue-laura-harvest": "Is your harvest enough to support the village?",
	"dialogue-laura-laura": "I'm Laura. Bound to the earth.",
	"dialogue-laura-wegetby": "Oh, we get by alright, don't you worry. It's hard work! Hard work! But the earth rewards us for our efforts.",
	"dialogue-laura-tried": "We tried expanding in the past. Years back, they say. Too risky. Too far from the walls and too much work.",
	"dialogue-laura-tobias": "Saint Tobias warned us about it, he did. Can't get too large or we start running into new problems. Problems we can't handle.",
	"dialogue-laura-likewhat": "Like what?",
	"dialogue-laura-otherpeople": "Like other people. When we're too big to come agreements, the village'll split. And a house with a crack down the middle of it'll never hold up when the true storm blows on through.",
	"dialogue-laura-goodluck": "No. Good luck to you.",

	"dialogue-lena-welcome": "Hi! Good to see a new face.",

	"dialogue-lena-shepherd": "You're a shepherd? You take your flock out to roam?",
	"dialogue-lena-lena": "Lena. I'm the shepherd here.",
	"dialogue-lena-ido": "I do. One of the guards will usually accompany me, and between the two of us we can handle most threats. We always return by nightfall of course.",
	"dialogue-lena-gerhardt": "Maybe Gerhardt would know? He gets out more than the rest of us.",

	"dialogue-folds-welcome": "Hey. Welcome to Nadiya. Any trouble on the journey?",
	"dialogue-folds-prison": "I found myself in a horrible underground prison.",
	"dialogue-folds-notrouble": "No trouble to speak of. Just a lot of riding.",
	"dialogue-folds-happen": "Yeah, that'll happen. Glad you made it out alright. Not so bad for a seraph, eh?",
	"dialogue-folds-seraph": "Seraph?",
	"dialogue-folds-supposenot": "I suppose not.",
	"dialogue-folds-sorry": "Sorry, I don't mean to assume. You just look a bit different is all.",

	"dialogue-folds-welcomeback": "Welcome back. What do you need?",
	"dialogue-folds-threesmiths": "Is there enough work for three smiths in one village?",
	"dialogue-folds-folds": "Folds. I run the smithy with my wife and the boy.",
	"dialogue-folds-surprised": "You'd be surprised. We work metal for our own in Nadiya here, but we get plenty of orders from outsiders too. Not many smithies out there, eh? And not many still working the old ways. Traders come through fairly often looking for Nadiyan forged iron.",
	"dialogue-folds-metal": "Where do you get the metal?",
	"dialogue-folds-wetrade": "We trade for it, mostly. Plenty of scrap from the nomads. Good fresh ore brought in from the traders. Dangerous work, mining. Delving into the cursed lands. Takes a madman to do it. Or it takes a whole village.",

Additional <a href=\"handbooksearch://boat seat\">seats</a> can be added to any of the eight cargo hold spots.<br><br>You can place containers (including chests, baskets, and storage vessels) in the hold of the boat, and access them on or off the boat.<br><br>You can also place a mount (such as an elk) on the boat by first placing a <a href=\"handbooksearch://wooden fence\">wooden fence post</a> in one of the cargo spots - being sure to leave 2 cargo spots empty aft of the post - and then using a <a href=\"handbook://item-rope\">rope</a> on this fence post, which will place the animal into the aft cargo spots. You can then disembark the animal using <hk>rightmouse</hk> on the fence post.<br><br>You can attach a <a href=\"handbooksearch://lantern\">lantern</a> to the aft face of the mast (about 3 meters up) to provide light.<br><br><a href=\"handbook://item-ratlines\">Ratlines</a> can be attached to the gunwhales on each side of the mast in order to allow you to climb to the top of the mast to look around.<br><br>An <a href=\"handbook://item-anchor-stone\">anchor</a> can be placed in the front-left space in the prow (though currently the anchor has no function).<br><br>There is also a spot at the prow for a chiseled figurehead to be placed, and on the port bow, your boat can be named (using pigment and <hk>shift</hk> + <hk>rightmouse</hk>-click).",

Set the Story Location:\nUse the following command to save the chosen location to your current position:\n<a href=\"chattype:///wgen story setpos locationname s[] true\">/wgen story setpos locationname s[] true</a>\nNote: This command saves the location but does not regenerate chunks immediately.<br><br>4. Generate New Chunks:\nBased on the output of the previous command, you’ll be told how far to delete the existing chunks.\nRun a command like /wgen delr 1 to delete the specified chunks and allow for regeneration.<br><br>Note: One chunk is by default 32 blocks.<br><br>You can reopen this dialog at any time using:\n<a href=\"chattype:///wgen story listmissing\">/wgen story listmissing</a><br><br>Missing story locations:",
