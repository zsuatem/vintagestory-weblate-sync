  "foodshelvesguide-text": "<strong>Food Shelves: Player's Guide</strong><br><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>This mod adds various storage options, such as shelves for display, baskets for decoration, and other specialized containers. Some blocks also provide <strong>mechanical effects</strong> like buffs to freshness, curing, or drying rates.<br><br><strong>Note</strong><br>This mod is built with <a href=\"https://mods.vintagestory.at/expandedfoods\">Expanded Foods</a> in mind. Certain blocks (for example, the Barrel Racks) will only <strong>Cure liquids</strong> if Expanded Foods is installed. Without it, they still apply freshness-related buffs, but no curing will occur.<br><br><strong>Block Buffs</strong><br>Some blocks offer buffs to <i>perish rate</i>, <i>curing rate</i>, or <i>drying rate</i>. If a block has such a buff, it will be shown directly in the block tooltip when you hover over it. These tooltips may also display helpful <i>quality-of-life</i> features - for example, <a href=\"handbook://block-foodshelves:seedbins-normal-east\">Seed Bins</a> show the nutrient type required by the seeds they contain.<br><br><strong>Ice Cooling Mechanic</strong><br>Blocks like the <a href=\"handbook://block-foodshelves:coolingcabinet-normal-east\">Cooling Cabinet</a> and <a href=\"handbook://block-foodshelves:meatfreezer-normal-east\">Meat Freezer</a> provide a small unbuffed freshness bonus while their doors are <strong>closed</strong>. Leaving them open negates this benefit, so always keep them shut!<br>These blocks can be further enhanced with <a href=\"handbook://item-foodshelves:cutice\">Cut Ice</a>. Ice is placed in a dedicated drawer, melts over time, and must be replaced regularly. The buff only applies when both the main compartment and the ice drawer are closed, so double-check those doors!<br><br><strong>Baskets for Decoration and Preservation</strong><br>Baskets are primarily decorative and not meant for bulk storage. However, when placed inside a <a href=\"handbook://block-foodshelves:coolingcabinet-normal-east\">Cooling Cabinet</a>, they inherit its freshness buffs (iced or not), making them a stylish way to preserve food a bit longer.<br><br><strong>Further Information</strong><br>Not all containers accept every item. Each block has a dedicated handbook entry that lists the valid item types and, when relevant, the mods those items come from.<br><br><strong>Interactions</strong><br>Most interactions are shown via <i>World Interactions</i> (floating in-game hints). For example: adding items to baskets, closing cabinet doors, or filling drawers with ice.<br>Some interactions are <strong>not</strong> displayed, particularly when baskets are inside cabinets. You can still place items directly into a basket (right-click with the correct item, or hold <strong>CTRL</strong> to insert multiple). With an empty hand, holding <strong>CTRL</strong> will take out one item at a time.<br><br><i>Enjoy your decorated, functional kitchens!</i>",
