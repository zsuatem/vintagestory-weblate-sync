  "fromgoldencombsguide-text": "<font align=\"center\"><i>\"How doth the little busy bee<br>Improve each shining hour<br>and gather honey all the day<br>From every opening flower!\"<br></i> - <strong>Isaac Watts</strong></font> <br><br> From Golden Combs is a mod that enhances the apiculture (\"Beekeeping\") opportunities available in Vintage Story. It achieves this by introducing two new types of hive that you can build, the ceramic hive, and the Langstroth hive.  Each of these hives have their own benefits and provide enhanced honeycomb production over the skep. As of this version, the only negative is that From Golden Combs hives don't propagate in the manner of the vanilla skep.  This was done to ensure that the basic skep remained valid and useful.<br><br>The history of apiculture can be traced back at least 10,000 years, which also marks the oldest known depiction of wild hive collection. Many approaches to creating domestic hives were tried, with pottery-based hives appearing about 9,000 years ago. This is also where your journey into advanced apiculture will begin in Vintage Story.<br>Ceramic hives are created from two components, the first being the <a href=\"handbook://block-fromgoldencombs:ceramicbroodpot-notop\">brood pot</a>. The brood pot is the base of the hive and will be the new home of your bee colony. The second component is the <a href=\"handbook://block-fromgoldencombs:hivetop-empty\">honey pot</a>, which sits atop the brood pot and will be where your colony stores their honey. Together, they create a perpetual source of honey that doesn't require breaking the hive to obtain your honeycomb.<br><br>Creation of a ceramic hive starts with the gathering of clay. Both blue clay and fire clay can be used to create the two parts of the ceramic hive using the clayforming process.  You will produce a <a href=\"handbook://block-fromgoldencombs:rawceramichive\">raw brood pot</a>, and a <a href=\"handbook://block-fromgoldencombs:hivetop-raw\">raw honey pot</a>, and will fire them in a pit kiln.  Once they have finished firing, they'll be ready to use! <br><br><br><font size=\"18\" color=\"#E9D7AB\" weight=\"bold\" lineheight=\"1.2\" align=\"center\"><br>Once fired, the brood pot cannot be carried in an inventory slot. You will need to have an open backpack slot to pick it up. <br> They can be accessed by pressing Ctrl+1-4 or holding control and using your scroll wheel.</font><br><br><br><br>Now that you have your brood pot and honey pot, place your brood pot wherever you want it.  Like skeps, they will require nearby flowers to produce their honey.  In addition, you must have an <a href=\"handbook://block-fromgoldencombs:hivetop-empty\">empty honey pot</a> placed on top of the hive for them to fill.<br><br>Of course, without bees, there won't be any honey. To fill your brood pot with bees you'll need a populated skep obtained through the usual manner.  However, instead of placing the populated skep itself, you'll directly interact with the fired brood pot with populated skep.  This will place your bee colony into the hive and consume the populated skep. Congratulations!  Your ceramic beehive will now produce honey for you! You can tell it's ready to harvest when a yellow ring appears on the honeypot on top of the brood pot.<br><br>Harvesting the honey pot is simple. Take it off, place it on the ground, and use a knife on it. You'll receive honeycomb and the pot will be empty. Place it back on the ceramic hive, and you're back in business.  In addition to being more convenient than skeps, on average they also produce more honeycomb.<br><br><font size=\"18\" color=\"#E9D7AB\" weight=\"bold\" lineheight=\"1.2\" align=\"center\"><br>Remember: You cannot produce more colonies from ceramic hives, you'll need skeps for that.</font><br><br>",

Hives will now accumulate \"crop charges\" over time, provided they're at Decent or better population. <br>Each hive has a different range in which it can affect crops. When a valid crop is harvested within its range, it will expend a crop charge and will improve all drops from the crop. <br>Every hive has a maximum number of crop charges it can hold, which it will reach within 30 days if it starts from having no crop charges at all.
