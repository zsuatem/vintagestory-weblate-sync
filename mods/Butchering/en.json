This is done by having to do several steps before you are able to get the resources out of an animal.\n\n    <font size=18 weight=bold align=center>How do I start butchering animals?<br>A step by step guide</font>\n\n<strong>Step 0:</strong>\n    You will need these things to start butchering:\n        - Any Knife\n        - <a href=\"handbooksearch://Skinning Hook\">Skinning Hook</a>\n        - <a href=\"handbooksearch://Butchering Table\">Butchering Table</a> (The Butchery Tables go into your backback slots and can be placed like a filled skep using <hk>ctrl</hk> + numbers 1-4 or scrollwheel. The Butchery Tables are 3 blocks wide and will extend 2 blocks to the right of where you place it.)\n        - Optional: <a href=\"handbooksearch://Butchering Bag\">Butchering Bag</a>\n        - Optional: Any Cleaver (Cleavers use less durability than knifes when processing the animal on a Butchering Table)\n\n<strong>Step 1:</strong>\n    When you kill a creature, you have two options. Either you cut it open and get only a small fraction of the items from it (for when you are truly desperate) or you right click it and it will be placed in a open bag slot (the four to the right of your hotbar). If you have a Butchering Bag it will be placed in your inventory instead.\n\n<strong>Step 2:</strong>\n    Bring that animal to a place where you have built a Skinning Hook. Right clicking this will place the animal upon the hook from your inventory or bag slot.\n\n<strong>Step 3:</strong>\n    Aiming at the hook, you hold right click with any knife until the creature is skinned.\n\n<strong>Step 4:</strong>\n    Wait for the creature to be bled out (this takes a short while). You will notice the body will change colour to a less red hue when it is done.\n\n<strong>Step 5:</strong>\n    Right click the hook again to take the body down and it will be once again placed into your inventory (if you have a butchery bag) or bag slots\n\n<strong>Step 6:</strong>\n    Place the bled-out body upon a Butchery Table then hold right click with any knife or cleaver. This will butcher the body into its raw bits and leave behind a bone carcass which can be broken for bones.\n",
