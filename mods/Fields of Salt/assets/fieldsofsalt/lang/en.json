But at the same time, one of the most time-consuming, taking days and weeks to get results. Therefore, huge areas completely covered with evaporation ponds are used to obtain the greatest benefits. And since evaporation ponds were often used to produce salt, such places became known as Fields of Salt.<br><br>To start producing salt from seawater, you will need evaporation ponds. You can create them using a solid polished stone as a border, and laying out the floor of polished stone slabs. Next, you need to check everything with the <a href=\"handbook://item-fieldsofsalt:pondtemplate\">template</a>, and the pond is ready!<br>But it seems to be quite difficult to constantly fill it with a bucket, so you can use the channel system to fill directly from the reservoir.<br>Having placed a <a href=\"handbook://block-fieldsofsalt:source-north\">sluice</a> to filter debris and living creatures, bring <a href=\"handbook://block-fieldsofsalt:channel-ns\">channels</a> from it to the <a href=\"handbook://block-fieldsofsalt:connector-granite-ns\">grooves</a> in the pond. And now your pond will be constantly full of seawater.<br>After waiting for a while, you can see that sediment is collecting at the bottom.
