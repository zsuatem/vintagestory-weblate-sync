    "game:gamemechanicinfo-aluminumprod-text": "<strong>Aluminum production</strong><br><i>For ages, mankind sought the weightless gleam of lighter metals</i><br><br>Aluminum metal is produced from processed alumina, which is also chemically processed from bauxite rock. Several steps involving chemical leaching and smelting come together to produce aluminum metal!<br><br><strong>Preparation</strong><br>Plenty of sulfuric acid and limewater will be required to process crushed bauxite into <a href=\"handbook://item-bauxitealuminum:powder-aluminum-oxide\">alumina</a> (also known as aluminum oxide). Limewater can also be substituted with lye if that option is available to you. Get all of your dirty pots and have some bloomeries on standby for these steps. Having at least 4 pots and 2 bloomeries ready should be enough to produce alumina at a decent speed.<br><br><strong>Production</strong><br>First, crush some bauxite stones and olivine. If you have a bit of powdered borax lying around, now it's your chance to make good use of it, since it can serve as a flux and help alumina separate into more aluminum metal, though it's an optional ingredient.<br><br>For 63 crushed bauxite, 63 crushed olivine, 8 powdered borax, 42l sulfuric acid, 42l limewater/lye and 30 quicklime, you will get 24 aluminum bits (or 18 without borax)<br><br><strong>Tip</strong>: With just 63 crushed olivine you will only use 7 pieces of alumina and be left with 8 spare pieces, so you can crush 1 more stack of olivine, add 21 extra liters of sulfuric acid and limewater/lye, 30 extra quicklime and 14 extra powdered borax to get around <strong>60 aluminum bits</strong> (or around 45 without borax)<br><br>Turn the crushed bauxite into <a href=\"handbook://item-bauxitealuminum:powder-aluminum-sulfate\">aluminum sulfate</a> through acid leaching with sulfuric acid. The mixture needs to be heated in a pot.<br><br>Take the aluminum sulfate and further heat it with limewater/lye in a pot to neutralize it into <a href=\"handbook://item-bauxitealuminum:powder-aluminum-hydroxide\">aluminum hydroxide</a>.<br><br>The aluminum hydroxide has to be calcined into <a href=\"handbook://item-bauxitealuminum:powder-aluminum-oxide\">aluminum oxide (alumina)</a> at high temperatures, so this is where the bloomery will first come into action. After around a day of waiting, you will get that precious alumina!<br><br>Alumina on its own cannot be turned into aluminum metal. It has to be reduced with a highly reactive metal, such as magnesium, through a thermal reaction.<br><br>To get magnesium, you will have to undergo a similar process to alumina, except you will take crushed olivine, which is rich in magnesium, and perform acid leaching in a barrel instead of a pot. The rest of the process towards producing <a href=\"handbook://item-bauxitealuminum:powder-magnesium-oxide\">magnesium oxide</a> is the same. Olivine requires very high temperatures to react, so it cannot be leached in heated sulfuric acid like you can with bauxite.<br><br>Magnesium oxide needs to be further reduced into finely-ground metallic magnesium in order to react with alumina. <a href=\"handbook://item-bauxitealuminum:powder-magnesium-metallic\">Powdered magnesium</a> is obtained by smelting <a href=\"handbook://item-bauxitealuminum:powder-magnesium-carbide\">magnesium-carbide charge</a> in a bloomery. Get <a href=\"handbook://item-bauxitealuminum:powder-calcium-carbide\">calcium carbide</a> by smelting quicklime at high temperatures.<br><br>Once you have both alumina and powdered magnesium, they can be mixed in the crafting grid to create <a href=\"handbook://item-bauxitealuminum:powder-aluminum-magnesium\">alumina-magnesium thermite</a>, or you can also add the powdered borax to create <a href=\"handbook://item-bauxitealuminum:powder-aluminum-magnesiumfluxed\">fluxed alumina-magnesium thermite</a>.<br><br>Finally, this mixture is further heated in a bloomery to make <a href=\"handbook://item-metalbit-aluminum\">aluminum bits</a>. Congratulations! Now you can smith these bits into all kinds of aluminum workpieces!"
