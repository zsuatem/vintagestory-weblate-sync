  "wool:gamemechanicinfo-animalshearing-text": "<strong>Animal Husbandry - Wool and Shearing</strong><br><br>Some domesticated animals can be sheared for their fleece. <br>The animal must be at least of generation 3 and be alive, but fleece can be still harvested from dead animals. <br>Use shears for best results. Alternatively, a knife can be used, however, this has a higher chance to injure the animal during shearing. <br>Animals will take some time to regrow their fleece. Higher generations of animals grow fleece faster and are less likely to be injured during shearing.<br><br>The kind and color of fleece depends on the animal species. Some even produce two colors at once!<br><br><strong>Configuraton</strong><br><br>Which species of animal can be sheared depends on your mod config. To configure this, and to activate the config, <strong><font color='#4080a0'>ConfigLib</font></strong> and <strong><font color='#4080a0'>ImGui</font></strong> need to be installed. <br>By default, bighorn sheep, goats, gazelle, elks, moose as well as deer can be shorn.",

  "wool:gamemechanicinfo-woolknitting-text": "<strong>Wool and Knitting</strong><br><br>To craft wool, wash raw animal fleece with lime water. The resulting wool fibers can then be combined into wool twine, or sometimes used directly for knitting. <br><br><strong>Colored Wool</strong><br><br>To dye wool, you need either wool twine or wool cloth. Then mordant these with either diluted borax, chromite or cassiterite in a barrel. The mordanted twine or cloth can then be sealed in a barrel with a dye of your choice.",
