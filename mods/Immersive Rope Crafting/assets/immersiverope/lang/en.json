To do this shift-right click a loose stone on the ground with a viable source of fiber (hover over a loose stone to see what items you can use). You can then hold right click with an empty hand and offhand to braid the rope as long as theres enough fiber on the unfinished rope to do it. Once you braid it enough times a finished rope item should be created."
